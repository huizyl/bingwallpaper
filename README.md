## How does it work?

Once per hour, the Bing server is queried for the most current wallpaper,
stores it in the folder where the exe-file is stored, and sets it as
your desktop background.

## What is the wallpaper size?

The Bing wallpaper is downloaded in full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels).

## Setup

Extract `BingWallpaper.exe` to a folder of your choice
(preferably outside of \Program Files),
and add a shortcut to your Startup folder.
