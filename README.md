## What is the wallpaper size?

The Bing wallpaper is downloaded in full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels).

## Windows

### How does it work?

Once per hour, the Bing server is queried for the most current wallpaper,
stores it in the folder where the exe-file is stored, and sets it as
your desktop background.

### Setup

Extract `BingWallpaper.exe` to a folder of your choice
(preferably outside of \Program Files),
and add a shortcut to your Startup folder.

## OS X

### How does it work?

Once you start the BingWallpaper app, the Bing server is queried for
the most current wallpaper, stores it in the Pictures folder,
and sets it as your desktop background.

### Setup

Double-click `BingWallpaper` to update your wallpaper.

The script does not stay active on OS X, so you donâ€™t have to see the
odd cog icon in your menu bar. If you want to keep your wallpaper fresh,
create a Calendar event that calls the app on a regular basis.

You may also want to add the BingWallpaper app to your Login items
in System Preferences.
